More and more people create and use a digital body on a regular basis.

Figureable explores our relationships to and with bodies through embodiment in games; what if it isn’t your (virtual) body changing the environment, but rather your own body being altered in its course? And what if this body changes in ways you do not find desirable?

The research documented on this site is geared towards the development of a video game engaging with the themes of body, environment and control. Simply put, the core concept for the end game is a virtual environment in which players need to sacrifice their own limbs to succeed.
